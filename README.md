# Melbourne-Housing-Analysis-R
This R project conducted an analysis of Melbourne housing data. It began by reading and exploring the dataset, which contains information on various attributes such as suburb, address, number of rooms, type of property, price, and more. Outliers in the price variable were identified and removed, resulting in a refined dataset. Visualizations were created to understand the distribution of house prices and the number of rooms across different regions.

Additionally, hypothesis testing was performed to evaluate:

1> Whether the average house price in Melbourne is $884,864.
2> If the mean number of rooms varies across different regions in Melbourne.
3> Whether the mean price of houses of type 'h' differs from houses of type 't'.
Statistical tests including one-sample t-test, ANOVA, and two-sample t-test were conducted to assess these hypotheses. The results indicated significant findings, allowing for insights into the housing market dynamics in Melbourne.

This project showcases proficiency in data analysis and statistical testing techniques using the R programming language.
